# Covid-19-Data-Exploration-SQL-Project
## Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth data exploration and analysis of a global COVID-19 dataset using SQL. The goal is to extract meaningful insights, identify trends, and answer specific questions about the pandemic's impact by manipulating and querying the data.

## Datasets

The analysis was performed on two primary datasets, which were used as the source for the SQL queries:

1.  COVID-19 Deaths Dataset: Contains information on global COVID-19 deaths.
2.  COVID-19 Vaccinations Dataset: Contains information on global COVID-19 vaccinations.

## Tools Used

* SQL: The primary tool used for all data cleaning, transformation, and querying to explore the dataset and extract insights.

## Key Findings & Insights

* Global Impact: What did you find about the overall global death toll using your queries?
* Vaccination Rollout: How did vaccination rates change over time and across different regions, based on your SQL analysis?
* Regional Analysis: Did you find any significant differences between countries or continents from your queries?

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the ability to use SQL to analyze a real-world dataset and draw conclusions. The insights gained from this exploration provide a clearer picture of the pandemic's impact on a global scale.
